This is the web application designed for natural disaster management and provides an optimal way of communication when the whole network is shattered.
This web application have been built for Microsoft Code Fun Do++ 2018 which have been came first among all the project in our Institute.
## Problem
During any disaster the communication between the relief forces and victims becomes a major problem due to low network connectivity. 
Also many lives are lost due to lack of proper evacuation and placement of the relief camp.
Our idea is to solve this problem by creating a USSD based messaging service which aims to bring faster connectivity between victim and relief forces. We want to focus on usability in low connection situations. We are also working on giving the best location for the Emergency response team.
